**Network Security Platform for public cloud**
---------------------------------------------------
Network Security Platform for the public cloud is a scalable, enterprise-class solution that provides real-time threat protection to your public cloud infrastructure. Elastic Compute Cloud by AWS enables you to deploy your virtual machines and host applications on the public cloud. Network Security Platform for AWS is a solution that protects instances in AWS environment from threats arising from outside the network or within. For more information about the solution refer the [data sheet](https://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/data-sheets/ds-virtual-network-security-platform.pdf) and [product info](https://www.mcafee.com/in/products/network-security-platform.aspx).

**AWS CloudFormation Template for vNSP Deployment**
-----------------------------------------------------
AWS CloudFormation simplifies provisioning and management on AWS. You can create templates for the service or application architectures you want and have AWS CloudFormation use those templates for quick and reliable provisioning of the services or applications (called “stacks”). You can also easily update or replicate the stacks as needed. For more info refer about [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
 
 The key features of vNSP CloudFormation Templates(CFT) are:
 
 - **Automated Solution Deployment**: The entire McAfee vNSP solution can be deployed in single click in less than an hour using CFT's developed in favor of customers and users to protect their workloads in AWS cloud.
 
 - **Customizable templates**: The templates provided here are open to the deployment environment and one can modify the template according to the existing network configuration in their cloud infrastructure. 
 
 - **Existing configuration deployment**: Customer based solution deployment with existing vNSP Network Security Manager(NSM). The CFT provides a flexible way to input parameters about existing cloud configurations and performs deployment accordingly.
 
 - **Creates better Security Configurations**: Reduces the risk of being breached in the public cloud by configuring tight security group configuration settings. It gives an option of configuring only the recommended services and ports settings automatically during the deployment.

- **Demo templates**: Customers and users who wants to experience or try out the demo of our Network Security Solution can use CFT. The CFT's which is being engineered exlusive for Demo purpose will perform the deployment on one click.
